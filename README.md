# 🧪 Test_Auto_gestion_stock_c

Automated testing suite for the [gestion_stock_c](https://github.com/amaraoussama94/gestion_stock_c) project, focused on verifying SQLite-backed product management operations.

This project includes functional, behavioral, and smoke tests designed to validate core CRUD workflows and binary stability in a clean, modular fashion.

## Running Python Tests

Make sure gestion_stock_c binary is compiled and available in build/.

python3 add_prod_test.py
python3 smoke_test.py

##  🔧 Running Shell-Based Tests (Planned)

bash run_tests.sh

##  💡 Test Type Glossary

Functional Test: Verifies correctness of isolated functions or features.

Behavioral Test: Validates user-like interactions and system responsiveness.

Smoke Test: Checks basic health (launches, exits, CLI parsing).

Scenario Test: Simulates real-world multi-step usage.

Regression Test: Guards against recurrence of previously fixed bugs.

#  🏗️ Planned Enhancements

✅ Migrate all tests to pure Python for cross-platform support

⚙️ Add test_common.py for reusable DB setup, teardown, and binary invocation

📊 Implement structured test reporting inside run_tests.py

🔄 Expand regression test coverage based on future bug fixes

## 🧪 Running Tests via CLI

### 🔹 Prerequisites
- Ensure the `gestion_stock_c` binary is compiled and available in the `build/` directory.
- Python 3.8+ installed.
- All test scripts are located in the `tests/` directory.
- Reports will be saved in `reports/` with Git version tagging.

---

### 🚀 Run Individual Tests

Use this for debugging or focused validation:

```bash
py  tests/add_prod_test.py
py tests/test_modification.py
```

### 🧩 Run All Tests with CI Orchestrator

This command runs all Python tests and generates structured reports:

```bash
py utils/ci_orchestrator.py
```
It will:

- 📦 Extract the current Git version from your repository history.

- 🧪 Automatically discover and execute all Python test scripts located in `tests/`.

- 🧾 Collect results including pass/fail status, duration, and logs (stdout/stderr).

- 📋 Generate structured reports and save them to:

  - `reports/<version>.json` → machine-readable output for CI systems or analytics.

  - `reports/<version>.md` → human-readable Markdown summary for contributors and reviews.

- 💠 Use UTF-8 encoding for reliable cross-platform compatibility.

- 🕒 Timestamp each run to ensure traceability across versions and environments.
